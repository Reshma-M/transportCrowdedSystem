Codes for modeling tranport of cargo in crowded environments (https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.12.434740v1.abstract)

1. Kymograph.cpp contains the Ccode for the steady-state properties and generating the kymographs 
2. Files Axotomy.cpp and Bleaching.cpp contain codes for simulating Axotomy and Fluorescence Recovery after Photobleaching (FRAP) assays, with SaveStates.cpp containing codes to generate steady-state configurations
3. expFit.py contains code for fitting the Axotomy data from the simulation to experiment
